title: project 1 phase 2

For this the phase two of the project 1, it feels more brand-new stuff comparing to the phase 1, but it's still manageable.
This time, I started early and in doing so I received enough help to handle some problems. Also it feels less intense than the phase 1,
probably we started earlier this time, so next time I would also start early to have some better experiences.
